Sorted List Array Documentation::

SortedListArray(int (*comp_items)(T* item_1, T* item_2), int (*comp_keys)(String* key, T* item));
	- this is the constructor for this class, to use it simply pass it the function pointers for the comp_items and 		comp_keys of the data type you are using (T)

~SortedListArray();
	-this is the destructor for this class, to use it simply use: delete <name of class instance>;

bool isEmpty();
	-this will return 1 if the list is empty, and a 0 if the list has 1+ items in it

int size();
	-this will return the number of items in your list

T* get(String* search_key);
	-to use this, simply pass it the name of the item you wish to retrieve from the list, and if that item is in the list, 		it will return that item

void add(T* item);
	-this adds your item of data type <T> to the list (sorts the list while it adds)

void remove(String* search_key);
	-this will remove your item named search_key from the list if it exsists

ListArrayIterator<T>* iterator();
	-this creates an iterator so you can easily iterate through your list
